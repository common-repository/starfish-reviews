The best WordPress plugin for generating 5-star customer reviews on Google, Facebook, Tripadvisor, and many more platforms. Starfish Reviews is the #1 review marketing plugin for WordPress!

== Description ==

**Now Available!  Capture Testimonials directly from your website and into your own site's database, then display these testimonials using a simple but feature-rich shortcodes anywhere on your site!**

= Review Marketing & Generation for Everyone! =

Does your business _need more reviews?_ Or are you an _online marketer_ who's client's would benefit from more reviews? If so, [Starfish Reviews](https://starfish.reviews) is the plugin for you! Starfish Reviews allows you to create and run review generation marketing campaigns right on your (or your client's) WordPress website. Easily encourage positive, 5-star ratings and reviews on almost any online review platform.

= How Review Generation Works =

1. Create a "funnel" with the familiar, friendly interface. 
2. Send the Funnel URL to your customers, users, followers, audience, etc and ask for feedback. 
3. The Starfish Reviews "funnel" asks users how they feel about your business, product, or service.
4. If they like it, they'll be sent to whatever URL you set in the Funnel settings. This should be a link to the reviews section of wherever you want to generate 5-star reviews.

It could be your Google My Business Reviews, [Facebook Recommendations](https://starfish.reviews/how-to-create-link-facebook-reviews/), Yelp listing, TripAdvisor page, podcast on iTunes, an Amazon product, or TrustPilot review page, or any other online review platform. Get 5-star reviews at any of those locations and many more!

Now you can import the reviews received from the different funnel destinations (Facebook, Google, Trustpilot, etc.) and display on your website using our custom Collections Builder (Premium Only)

If people are not so happy with your product, service, media, etc., they'll be asked to provide feedback directly to you. This helps offset people's natural tendency to only post reviews when they're upset, or when they've totally misunderstood the purpose of the review. You'll still learn what you can do to improve, but it won't be published permanently for the whole world to see.
